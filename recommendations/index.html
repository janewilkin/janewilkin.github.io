            <p>Jane is a true one of a kind, with the ability to understand and contribute to strategic planning, to anticipate business needs, and find / build strong technical solutions. She has outstanding communication skills, which she leverages with her team mates, with customers, leadership and other key stakeholders on her projects. She's extremely talented at finding and vetting solutions, presenting build vs. buy cases, and in creating scalable solutions. A true pleasure to work with and someone I would HIGHLY recommend for any project. I hope to have the chance to work with her again in the future!</p>

            <p>Jane is a passionate technologist in every sense. That passion and inquisitive nature allows them to seek to solve problems at their core rather than treat symptoms while also proactively building solutions that answer questions that have not even been asked yet. Jane showed that they could contribute in a number of different ways at Parse.ly including customer integrations, knowledge base support, and internal product builds and was always eager to grab new projects as they came up.</p>

        <div class="recommendation">
          <blockquote class="recommendation__text">
            <p>I first met Jane at a conference where she was excitedly discussing the virtues of open HTTP APIs. I later learned she had written about the topic for ProgrammableWeb.com, and instantly thought, "A bright engineer who can also write? I need to hire her!" I later learned that she organized hackathons on her own, including several in the civic space.</p>
            <p>Months later, I had the privilege of hiring Jane for Parse.ly's product team. She has an infectiously positive attitude and loves creating community around products and technologies. She instantly added value to our growing company by documenting our API services, building example projects, and evangelizing our API's use in the media industry. Her efforts helped our platform grow from a mere 200M API calls per month to nearly 1.2 billion per month in the span of less than a year. She even showcased our platform at important events, such as a widely-praised hackathon held at MIT's Media Lab. In her interactions with customers, she provided detailed feedback and helpful suggestions. She was also supremely professional, even under extreme pressure.</p>
            <p>What else? Oh, right: Jane is a great technologist, too! She is motivated, bright, determined, and constantly seeking to better herself. Her comfort with HTTP, web technologies, and JavaScript shines through, but she also supports that with a hacker mindset and strong skills in the UNIX command-line. She didn't know any Python when she joined Parse.ly, but once she became comfortable with our stack, she was contributing new functionality for our internal tooling and analytics atop the Django framework. She's a quick study and really immerses herself in her work.</p>
            <p>Overall, I strongly recommend Jane. If you're looking for a motivated developer who communicates well and understands not only how to hack, but how to inspire others, then you should leap at an opportunity to work with her.</p>

        <div class="recommendation">
          <blockquote class="recommendation__text">
            <p>In just eight months so far writing for ProgrammableWeb, Jane published nearly 100 blog posts. 75% of those posts covered new APIs, which meant she had to look at something few others have written about, understand it and communicate it to our developer audience. It takes a special person who can do this at all, let alone with the consistency Jane has displayed. Above all else, I appreciate Jane's enthusiasm. It is that enthusiasm that fuels her exploration of new APIs and services. I'm grateful that I have this opportunity to work with Jane.</p>

            <p>Jane was a dedicated and passionate developer evangelist for Parse.ly. She went above and beyond her title to delight customers with experiments, to broaden the depth of our tech stack, and to infuse energy on the team. She was especially well versed at interfacing with customers, understanding their immediate and long term needs, and translating that back to the rest of the team. In many cases Jane took on customer requests and built them herself, again, going beyond the scope of her role. I highly recommend Jane for any software oriented or technology company, and am happy to be a direct reference for her!</p>
